SONOSPY GUI READ ME
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need to get wxPython 3.0+ in order to run the GUI (http://www.wxpython.org/download.php)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, everything has a tool tip associated with it for some attempts
at clarity.

Preferences are stored in gui/GUIpref.ini and can be manually edited or
can be saved within the app on each specific tab using the SAVE DEFAULTS
button.

On first run it will can for available Sonos zones.

You can run this by ./sonospyGUI.py (Linux) or python sonospyGUI.py
(Linux/Windows).  Databases created here are still stored where scan, etc.
uses them.  If you have Windows setup right, you can double clicke on the
sonospyGUI.py file in your root sonospy folder.

[LAUNCH]
 - Will launch and stop Sonospy.
 - AUTO POPULATE will search for databases (extensions can be set in
   GUIpref.ini) and will autopopulate the databases and proxy names for you.

[VOLUME]
 - Allows for zone volume limits, quiet hours with volume limits and mute hours.

[SCAN]
 - SCAN and REPAIR both log to the log window, but it comes through
   chunk at a time.  Not quite in realtime, but close enough.

[EXTRACT]
 - Allows for subdividing of 1 database into mulitple databases.
 
 [VIRTUALS]
 - For management and creation of virtual playlists.

KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[VIRTUALS]
 - Loading virtuals only works with one "set".  If you store more than one
   virtual/work in an .SP file, it won't work.  Best to use the SP files
   created with the GUI until I find a solution here in terms of GUI layout.

[VOLUME]   
 - The volume monitor seems to stop working after an extended
   period of time.  Disable and re-enabling it seems to fix things.  Not sure
   why this is happening.

[EXTRACT]
 - Last <X> Albums is experimental, it gets the job done, but it's not
   perfect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GENERAL]
 - Look at the PIP installer.  PyInstaller?
 - Find out how to store comments in the GUIpref.ini

[LAUNCH]
 - Add a logging window that reads playcount.log and reports back to a TextCtrl
   to keep track of what has been played.
 - Activate logging via a logging window below scratchpad on launch.

[SCAN]

[USERINDEX]
 - Consider a tab to allow for generation of a userindex.ini file.

[VIRTUALS]
 - How to handle multiple SPs in one file? Do I bother?
 - Implement an ignoreChar list to manage lines to ignore based on line[0]
 
 [VOLUME]
